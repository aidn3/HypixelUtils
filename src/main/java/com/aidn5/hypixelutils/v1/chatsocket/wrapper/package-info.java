 * Package contains a convenient classes making receiving
 * connections less hassle. It provide way to register listeners to every
 * individual action (instead of all the actions for an id). It also handles the
 * incoming connections request by sending a click-able message to the user to
 * inform them. Clicking the message will trigger the callback. All unsuccessful
 * connections and timing out will be internally handled (and informed to the
 * client).
